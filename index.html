            <p>
                This is the home page for our group.
                It's early in the module so we haven't started anything yet.
                But <a href="./people/ggstuart.html">Graeme</a> has added some example content.

                    All students need to create a profile page in the people folder (and linked in <a href="/people">the people index</a> ).
                    Profile pages should contain the following information.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Who am I?</li>
                    <li>What experience do I have in web development?</li>
                    <li>What am I keen to learn from this module?</li>
                    <li>What kind of project would I like to be involved in?</li>
                    <li>
                        A list of tentative, possibly part-formed ideas for projects.
                        Even if they're just application names.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>We need to discuss any ideas for proposals as a group and see which ideas feel most viable.</p>
                <p>
                    Once we have ideas, we need to work in groups to create draft proposal pages (linked in <a href="/proposals">proposals</a> ) with the following information.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The proposed application name</li>
                    <li>A brief overview of the application</li>
                    <li>who are the users of the system?</li>
                    <li>Are there different types of users? e.g. administrators?</li>
                    <li>What data are involved?</li>
                    <li>Suggested user interface components</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

                <p>
                    Once we have a few proposals in place, we can start creating teams.
                    Students interested in working on a proposed project idea together can start a team by creating a new page.
                    There are no limits to the size of teams, and it's not a problem if multiple teams want to build the same applicaiton.
                </p>
                <p>
                    team pages should include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A team name</li>
                        <li>A list of team members</li>
                        <li>A reference to the project you are building</li>
                        <li>Notes on progress</li>
                        <li>information about whether you are inviting new members and what skills you might need</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
